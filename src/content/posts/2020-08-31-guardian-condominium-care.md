I had done a lot of work with Guardian for many years in last job as a property manager. When I first met with the owner Geoff, He was very keen on getting an updated site and it was refreshing how brand oriented he was. 

Geoff didn't want anything generic or out of the box. THAT is something I love to hear. I really feel we found a very nice unique design that still follows modern UX best practices.
