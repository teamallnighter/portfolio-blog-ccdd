This is a simple spam filtering technique where we build a hidden form field that humans can't see. A bot would fill out the field so that would be sent to the spam filter. 

```html
<!--this tell netlify we are using this form and what field is hidden-->
<form class="form-template-v3" method="POST" netlify-honeypot="bot-field" data-netlify="true">
 
  <!--This is the field itself-->
   <p class="hidden" style="display:none">
      <label>Donâ€™t fill this out if you're human: <input name="bot-field" /></label>
   </p>
  
```

Thats all you need!
