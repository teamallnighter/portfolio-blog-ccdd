VYYL is a local producer/DJ duo from Calgary. They are good friends of mine and when they wanted to do some rebranding I helped them with a new website, server and email.

The site uses several API's including the soundcloud API. I decided to use that as the main music player as soundcloud is free to everyone where as apple music and spotify both require logins. 

There is a pop up lightbox gallery for images that is responsive so it works on both large and small screens. 

Some looping content for the about us section. 

A netlify form that captures abandoned forms, has a honeypot for spam and notifies the duo via email. 

To Do:

Implement spotifu and apple music API's 
Set up no code blog
